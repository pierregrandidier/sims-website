DRelief ERU delegate, Cash delegate, Mobile Data Collection trainer.
After 14 years in the private sector, I started as a volunteer with Luxemburg Red Cross in 2011 and was trained as Relief ERU in 2012. I have been deployed to emergencies in Niger, Burundi, the Philippines (typhoon Haiyan), Nepal, Ha√Øti, Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia.
I have been informally involved with SIMS in 2017/2018 for the Africa food crisis, and the Bangladesh population movement.
I am also active as a consultant, mainly focusing on mobile data collection for disaster preparedness, with missions to Senegal, Burkina Faso, Costa Rica and Colombia.
I speak French, English and Spanish.
